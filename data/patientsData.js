    background: "Mary, now 42 years old, was born with a congenital heart defect that shaped much of her early life. As a child, she often struggled with fatigue, shortness of breath, and the inability to keep up with others her age. Her parents had limited resources and were unable to afford the specialized surgery she desperately needed. For years, her family lived in fear, watching her health slowly decline while holding on to hope for a miracle.",

The foundation stood with her every step of the way, making sure she was not only treated but cared for as a whole person.",

Her renewed energy and vibrant spirit are a testament to the success of her treatment and the compassion of those who made it possible. What once seemed like a life defined by limitations has transformed into one filled with purpose, gratitude, and hope.",

Donations covered the cost of her surgery, recovery, and counseling for her and her family, ensuring they never faced the burden alone.
